Normalization: It is the process to minimize the redundancy of the data and remove the anamolies.

anamolies: insert/update/delete

1 NF: Attribute  should not be repeated, and divide the attribute in the meaning full attribute.
     row should be uniquely identify.
     I nf => primary key


2 NF: The table must be 1 nf and each non-key should depend upon key.
IF the table is not normalized to 2 nf, then we can face anamolies problem.


3 NF: The table must be 2 nf and the non-key should not depend upon other non-key.

A -> B, B-> C then  A, B, C should not be in the same table
