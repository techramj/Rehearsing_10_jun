key: The attribute which identify the row uniquely
eg: id , mobile

Non key: The attribute which do not identify the row uniquely
eg: name, salary

super key: The attribute or set of attributes which identify the row uniquely.

subset of attributes which identify the row uniquely
subset 1,2 3 = {1,2,3}, {1,2} ,{1,3}, {2,3},{1}, {2},{3} => 2^n -1

Candidate key: Column or set of columns which identify the row uniquely.
It is the minimal set of super key.

for emp table: id ,  mob is candidate key

for sales table: order+item


Primary key: Primay key is a candidate key which can uniquely identify the row and it cannot be null.

emp: pk => id
sales : pk => order+item


alternate key: 
emp: alternate key=> mob
     sales => 


foreign key: The candidate key which refer in another table


unique key: The candidate key where null is allowed.


composite key: the candidate key having more than one columns.


surrogate key: The key which don't have actual meaning in the table. Just for the uniquness , column is added.

differnce b/w primary key and unique key:

primary key is a candidate key where null is not allowed.
unqiue key is a candidate key where null is  allowed.

candiate key: attribute or set of attributes which identify the row uniquely
              and it is a minimal set of super key.
